                <div class="overview">
                    <h2>Overview</h2>
                    <p>Dragontown is a fictional place where humans, animals, and creatures all live. The community is not only diverse by species, but by economic and social standing. Recently, there has been a notable rise of issues between members of the community, motivating the mayor to commision my team to help address them. </p>
                    
                    <h3>Target Audience</h3>
                    <p>This site was developed with the members of the Dragontown community in mind. This included fictional characters from a wide array of species, including sheep, wolves, pigs, and humans.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="goal">
                <h3>Goal</h3>
                    <ul>
                    <li>To create a solution for a web campaign to tackle issues within the Dragontown community </li>
                        <li>To produce a site that is accessible to its target users.</li>
                        </ul>
                </div>
                <div class="research">
                    <h2>Research</h2>
                    <h3>Ethnographies</h3>
                    <p>Each member of the group performed an ethnography on Dragontown by reading three storybooks; The True Story of the 3 Little Pigs by John Scieszka, The Three Pigs by David Weisner, and Thereâ€™s a Wolf at the Door by Zoe B. Alley. </p>

                    <p>We then highlighted key issues that seemed to arise, including an imbalance of power among creatures, animosity between species, boundaries between social classes, and the isolation of children.</p>
                    <h3>Narrowing the Scope</h3>
                    <p>As a team we narrowed down our focus to one key issue: lack of community. We felt that the community was very modular and that a lot of the issues that the town was facing could not be solved without first bringing the community together. Promoting a sense of community would have an immediate positive impact and set up an environment that other issues could be addressed.</p>
                    <p>After a project pitch for the Farmers Market was accepted, my team and I concreted what pages and what content would be available to a user and how they would be accessed.
                        The farmers market would allow members of Dragontown to display their skill set and interests with other community members while providing a safe and friendly environment to make a profit and socialize with others.</p>
                    <div class="user">
                        <h3>User Personas</h3>
                    
                        <p>Each member was then tasked with creating a user persona for a member of the community. I chose to represent one of the sheep in the town and developed his character to include his experience/ motivations/stresses, the context in which he would use a website, and any key tasks he would like to accomplish while using it</p>
                    </div>
                    <h3>Accessibilty</h3>
                    <p>Several accessibility concerns were accounted for while developing user personas. Significantly:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Colorblindness &mdash; Several creatures have dichromatic color blindness.</li>
                            
                        <li>Physical Limitations &mdash; Some creatures will be accessing devices using hooves or noses.</li>
                
                        <li>Site will have to be responsive to all screen sizes.</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>
                <div class="ideation">
                <h2>Ideation</h2>

                <div class="development">
                    <h3>Development</h3>
                    <p>The site was built using HTML, CSS, and some javascript. This was an iterative process; input from critiques and user testing by collegues was used to influence design decisions.</p></div>
