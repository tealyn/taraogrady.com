                    <p>I transferred to SUNY Oswego as a Math major because I had always been good at math. However, the class that had the greatest impact on me was an intro course to Cognitive Science. At the time I was also working as a florist and loving it. I decided college was not for me and dropped out..</p>

                    <p>When the florist closed, I began to work full time as a medical scribe in an Emergency Room. Being in a learning environment motivated me to go back to school. I was considering going into a medical field, but I could not get my mind off of Cognitive Science.</p>

                    <p>I returned to school to study Cognitive Science full time and received a B.A. with minors in Psychology and Mathematics. I focused on topics in semiotics and affective computing.

                    <p>After graduating with my BA I found that I was drawn to UX and UI. I loved that I could combine research and design to produce something empathetic towards a user. Over the summer of 2018 I completed an internship in Vietnam working with developers, and was able to start and co-found an organization aimed at getting women involved in tech. 
                    </p>
                    <p>During my final semester of graduate school I have challenged myself to learn new skills (such as web design) and have pursued research involving virtual environments and memory.</p>
