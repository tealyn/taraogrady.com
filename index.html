            <img id="timeline" src="assets/timeline.png" alt="Timeline of what got Tara interested in UX. She first attended Manhattan College as a Chemical Engineer and hated it. During that time she took an artificial psychology course that she liked. She then went to the State University of New York at Oswego with a major in mathematics. The class that impacted her the most during this time was an introduction to Cognitive Psychology. Sadly, she decided she did not want to continue college and left, working full time as a medical scribe in an Emergency Room. The learning environment motivated her to go back to school, and she received a B.A. in Cognitive Science with minors in mathematics and psychology. She found herself drawn to UX roles, and returned to complete a MA in Human-Computer Interaction. During this time she has been able to complete an internship in Vietnam and co-found an organization abroad that it focused at closing the gender gap in technology. She will complete her MA in December, 2018.">
