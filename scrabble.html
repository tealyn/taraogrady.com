        <p>This application is the result of a class project involving <span style="color:#3e543f;, font-size:26px;">44</span> members. 
        The class was structured to emulate a startup, designing a word tabletop game for a workstation in the science center that could be accessed by a mobile device or laptop. The class used an Agile Development framework to complete this task.</p>
            <br/>
        <p>Students were split into the following teams:</p>
        <div class="stuff">
            <div class="borders">Requirements</div>
            <div class="blue">Database</div>
            <div class="red">Database</div>
            <div class="borders">Usabilty</div>
            <div class="blue">GUI</div>
             <div class="red">GUI</div>
            <div class="borders">Quality Assurance</div>
            <div class="blue">Engine</div>   
            <div class="red">Engine</div>
            
        </div>
            <p> Where Requirements, Usability, and Quaity Assurance were part of the overarching team, and Red and Blue were competing to create the final product. I was lead of Blue Engine and team lead overall for the Blue Team. </p>
            
            <section>
            As Blue team lead I was responsible for:

            <li>Planning weekly sprints and milestones</li>
            <li>Collaborating with overarching teams to ensure requirements were met</li>
            <li>Facilitating communication among GUI, Engine, and Database teams</li>
