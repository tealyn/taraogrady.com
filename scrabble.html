        <p>This application is the result of a class project involving 44 members. The class was structured to emulate a startup, designing a word tabletop game for a workstation in the science center that could be accessed by a mobile device or laptop. The class used an Agile Development framework to complete this task.</p>
            <br/>
        <p>Students were split into the following teams:</p>
        <ul>

            <li>Quality Assurance</li>
            <li>Database (Red or Blue)</li>

            <li>Graphical User Interface (Red or Blue)</li>
            </ul>
        
            <p> Where Requirements, Usability, and Quaity Assurance were part of the overarching team, and Red and Blue were competing to create the final product. I was lead of Blue Engine and team lead overall for the Blue Team. </p>
